## REACT DELETE CONFIRM

This is a reusable React component that you can tie to a delete method.  If you've ever delete a repository from Github you are familiar with what this is for!  Upon clicking the main button a user will be presented with a modal and an input, they'll need to type the name of what they want to delete exactly in order to go through with the deletion.

## INSTALLATION

This is availble through npm, just run ```npm install react-delete-confirm```
